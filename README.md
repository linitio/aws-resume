This theme is designed by Kevin Allioli 

I have made this into a Jekyll Theme.
**Demo:** [http://webjeda.com/online-cv/](http://webjeda.com/online-cv/)

The default theme would look like this

![online cv Jekyll theme](https://github.com/kallioli/aws-resume/raw/master/assets/images/online-cv-jekyll-theme.png)

The theme is responsive

## Installation
* Fork the repository
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your new site should be ready at https://username.github.io/online-cv/
